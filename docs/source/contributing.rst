Contributing to JustDial Lead Generator
=======================================

Weâ€™re glad youâ€™re interested in contributing!  
This project is built with the idea of learning, experimenting, and growing together.  
Whether youâ€™re fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or writing tests, every contribution is welcome.

How to Contribute
-----------------
1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the repo to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Make your changes in a new branch. Use a descriptive branch name:  
   ``feature/add-google-drive-export`` or ``fix/timeout-error``.

3. **Make Changes**  
   - Follow clean, readable coding practices.  
   - Keep commits small and meaningful.  
   - Add comments where helpful.

4. **Write or Update Tests**  
   If youâ€™re adding functionality, consider writing your own tests.  
   - Place tests inside the ``tests/`` directory.  
   - We encourage contributors to experiment and create test cases for new anti-bot handling, custom data export, or any other edge cases.

5. **Run Tests Locally**  
   Make sure existing and new tests pass before submitting your work.  
   (We may add automated test workflows later, so a good habit now helps.)

6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Open a PR against the ``main`` branch.  
   - Clearly describe what your changes do.  
   - Reference any related issues.  

Guidelines
----------
- Keep contributions **professional, modular, and documented**.  
- If adding dependencies, explain why theyâ€™re necessary.  
- Be respectful of othersâ€™ workâ€”this is a collaborative space.  
- Donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue first if youâ€™re unsure about something.

Encouragement
-------------
This project is not just about scrapingâ€”itâ€™s about building reliable, scalable, and flexible tools while learning together.  
If youâ€™ve got a new idea (maybe scraping different categories, improving speed, or adding new export formats), weâ€™d love to see it!  

Your creativity and experimentation are what make this project stronger. ðŸš€
